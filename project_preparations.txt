Phrases and names to be elaborated:
1.	Kernel
	Main component of a Linux operating system and the core interface between a computer hardware and its processes.
	It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possibe.
	Kernel jobs:
		- Memory management: keep track of how much memory is used to store what and where.
		- Process management: determine which processes can use the CPU, when and for how long.
		- Device drivers: Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes.
		- System calls and security: receive request for service from the processes.
2.	AppArmor
	Debian 10 and onward have AppArmor by default.
	AppArmor help in protection the system against known and unknown vulnerabilities.
	AppArmor apply set of rules (profiles) that specify what files a given program can access.
	In contrast to SELinux the rules applied do not depend on the user. All users face the same set of rules when they are executing the same program.
	Profiles contain a list of access control rules on resources that each program can make use of.
	Profiles are compiled and loaded into kernel by the 'apparmor_parser' command.
	Command 'aa-status' will check if it is running.
3.	Disk partiotion
	Disk partitioning is a creation of one or more storage regions (called partitions).
	Thanks to that each region can be managed separately.
	It is common practice to reserve partitions for services that can generate a lot of volume in order to avoid saturating the system partitions.
	Short list of partitions that we use in this project:
		- '/' contains the rest of the tree
		- '/boot' contains data that is used before the kernel begins execiting user-mode programs
		- '/var' contains variable files
		- '/tmp' contains temporary files
		- '/home' contains HOME users
4.	LVM
	LVM = logical volume management.
	LVM provides greater view of the disk storage on a computer system.
	Storage volumes created under the control of LVM can be resized and moved around easly.
	Encrypted LVM is protection of the confidentiality of data.
	GRUB v1 and LILO is not compatible with LVM. In such situation they should be outside the storage disk managed by LVM.
	LVM commands:
		- 'lvmchange' change attributes of the LVM
		- 'lvmdiskscan' scan for all devices visible to LVM2
		- 'lvmdump' creat lvm2 information dumps for diagnostic purposes
		There is also a lot of commends for Physical Volumes (PV) and Volume Groups (VG) but for this project we will focus on Logical Volumes (LV):
		- 'lvchange' change attributes of a LV
		- 'lvconvert' converting a LV from linear to mirror snapshot.
		- 'lvcreate' create a LV in existing Volume Groups.
		- 'lvdisplay' display the attributes of a LV
		- 'lvextend' extend the size of a LV
		- 'lvreduce' reduce the size of a LV
		- 'lvremove' remove a LV
		- 'lvrename' rename a LV
		- 'lvresize' resize a LV
		- 'lvs' report information about LV
		- 'lvscan' scan (all disks) for LV
5.	SSH and ports
	SSH = Secore Shell
	Protocol for secore remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.
	Main configuration files for SSH:
		- ssh_config: client configuration file
		- sshd_config: server configuration file
	Port numbers are used to distinguish between different services that run over transport protocols.
	Port numbers are assinged based o three ranges:
		- System ports (0-1023). They are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services.
		- User ports (1024-49151). They are assigned by IANA (organization that oversees global IP address allocation). 
		Port 4242 is assigned to DICOM server (digital storage and transmission of medical images) and/or 
		Quassel (allows simultaneouns connections to multiple IRC servers).
		- Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535). Used for private or customized services for temporary purposes.
6.	UFW
	UFW = Uncomplicated Firewall
	Provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface for manipulating the firewall.
	Its role is to secure a network by defining the allowed or forbidden communicatios via rules.
	'ufw allow ####' is used for setting up a rule.
7.	Users, Groups
	Linux uses groups as a way to organize users. They exist to make permissionig of files and folders simpler.
	Linux was designed to allow more than one user to have access to the system at the same time but with different permissions.
8.	Root
	Name of the most powerful account. Also known as supervisor, superuser and administrator.
	If debian uses SELinux root is just another account.
	In terminal we can use 'su' to change our identity to root.
9.	SUDO
	Sudo = Superuser do
	Sudo gives the designated user a power to act as an administrator temporarly.
	Its give another user limited access to another user account for the purpose of performing tasks.
	File "/etc/sudoers" contains rights given to users.
10.	TTY
	TTY = TeleTypewritter
	'tty' will tell us what is the name of our terminal.
11.	Aptitude and apt
	'aptitude' remembers which packages were explicitly requested and which were only installed due to dependencies.
	It will automatically ununstall packages which were not explicitly requested when they are no longer needed.
	'apt' will only do explicitly what it is told to do in the command line.
12.	SELinux
	SELinux = Secirity-Enhanced Linux
	It differs from regular Linux security in that in addition to the traditional UNIX user id and group id, it also attaches a SELinux user, role, domain (type), and sensitivity label to each file and process.
13.	Git and Vim
	Git lets us track changes in files and compare different versions, it also allows going back to a previous version of certain file.
	In practice git allows creating a repository, indexing, commiting, branching, reverting, cloning, pushing.
	Vim is a full-featured text editor.

	- 'grep' is a tool for filter text files, multiple file names, finding lines in files/folders. 
		Basic syntex looks as follows: grep [OPTIONS] pattern [FILE], where:
		+ grep - the utility name
		+ options - arguments that modify the grep command's behavior
			* '-r' search all files in folder
			* '-A(number of lines)' prints the line after the matching entry

		+ awk - the utility name
		+ PATTERN - is a text string or a pattren used to filter the output of the specified command
		+ ACTION - is the action to perform on the lines matching the specified pattern
		To print one or more specific columns instead of entire line we can use syntax $, for example: $number_of_the_column
		Addinf '-F 'x'' will replace space delimiter (default delimiter) for x delimiter
		To count the occurrences of specified pattern we can increment a variable using '++'
		To add up the values of column and print their sum we can use '+='
		We need to remember to use 'END' to specify a command to execute once all the lines are processed
	- 'df' Show partitions structure and their usage
		Adding '-h' will show informations in megabytes (MB)

		First parameter makes the values measured and delivered every x seconds
		Second parameter make the values will be delivered x times, then the program will be terminated
	- 'tail' Prints the last N numbers of data of the given input.
		Basic syntax looks as follows: tail OPTION FILE, where:
		+ tail - the utility name
		+ OPTION - arguments that modify the tail command's behavior
			* '-x' where x is a number. Prints last x lines
			* '+x' where x is a number. Prints the data starting from x line.
			* '-n x' or '--lines x' prints last x lines

		+ FILE - name of the file or its location
		By default it prints last 10 lines of specified file.
